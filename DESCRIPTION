Description: Fit Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Generalized Linear Models (STDGLM), where a set of coefficients is allowed to vary in space and time, and another (optional) set remains constant. Temporal dependence is modeled through a state-space approach, while spatial dependence is modeled through either Gaussian Processes or a lattice-based approach. The package also provides functions for prediction, model comparison, and visualization of results.
